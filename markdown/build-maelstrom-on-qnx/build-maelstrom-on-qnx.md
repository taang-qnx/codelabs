## Setup the Project

Duration: 1:00

> aside positive
>
> Note: We will use ~/repos as an example development workspace for the rest of this exercise.  Feel free to use the folder of your choice instead.

1. Navigate to your development workspace:

    ```bash
    cd ~/repos
    ```

2. Run the following command to clone the Maelstrom repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/Maelstrom.git -b Maelstrom3
    cd ~/repos/Maelstrom
    git checkout 063c388fb6e4b7365d005cd25f56844ef94aca51
    ```

    This command will checkout a specific commit from the Maelstrom3 branch.

3. Download the patch from the link below and save it in the repo folder:

    [Maelstrom.patch](./Maelstrom.patch)

4. Run the following command to apply the patch:

    ```bash
    git apply ./Maelstrom.patch
    ```

5. Delete the patch after it is applied.

    ```bash
    rm ./Maelstrom.patch
    ```
